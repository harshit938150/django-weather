# django-weather
Hello if you are viewing this Repository  I guess you are a beginner to Django trying to do projects. Building a weather app in Django is a  next-level process after you get the idea and understanding of implementations of CRUD(Create-Read-Update-Delete)operations.

By building the weather Application you get the basic idea of how to integrate an API in your Django application.  In this weather project, I have used openweathermap.org API which gives complete weather information of a place.

When I got stuck in the middle I referred to a video of the BekBrace youtube channel. 

Happy coding!!
